**UiProject: Building Next-Gen User Interfaces with Rust**

UiProject is a cutting-edge, Rust-based framework designed to revolutionize the way we build user interfaces. By leveraging the power of Rust's ownership model and borrow checker, UiProject provides a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for crafting complex UI components.

UiProject's primary goal is to bridge the gap between the web and desktop ecosystems, enabling developers to create seamless, cross-platform experiences that delight users. This project is built upon a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily integrate and extend existing UI components, as well as create new ones from scratch. With UiProject, developers can focus on crafting exceptional user experiences, while the framework handles the heavy lifting of rendering, layout, and event handling.

One of the key benefits of UiProject is its ability to simplify the development process by providing a unified API for both web and desktop applications. This means that developers can write UI code once and deploy it across multiple platforms, without worrying about the underlying implementation details. Additionally, UiProject's Rust foundation ensures memory safety, preventing common errors and ensuring the overall stability of the application.

**Key Features**

* **Modular Architecture**: UiProject's modular design allows developers to easily compose and reuse UI components, making it simple to build complex interfaces.
* **Unified API**: The framework provides a single, consistent API for both web and desktop applications, eliminating the need for platform-specific code.
* **Rust-based**: Built on top of the Rust programming language, UiProject leverages Rust's ownership model and borrow checker to ensure memory safety and prevent common errors.
* **High-performance rendering**: UiProject utilizes a custom rendering engine, optimized for performance and scalability, to deliver fast and responsive UI experiences.
* **Customizable**: The framework provides a wide range of customization options, allowing developers to tailor the UI to their specific needs.
* **Extensive library**: UiProject comes with an extensive library of pre-built UI components, making it easy to get started and build complex interfaces.

**Technology Stack**

* **Rust**: The primary programming language used for building UiProject.
* **WebAssembly**: Used for compiling Rust code to WebAssembly, enabling deployment on web platforms.
* **gtk-rs**: A Rust wrapper for the GTK+ library, providing a native GUI toolkit for desktop applications.
* **CSS**: Used for styling and layout in web applications.

**Installation**

To get started with UiProject, follow these steps:

1. Install Rust and Cargo using the official installation instructions.
2. Clone the UiProject repository using `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/UiProject.git`.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `cargo build` to build the project.
4. Run `cargo run` to start the development server.

**Configuration**

UiProject relies on several environment variables to configure the development environment. These include:

* ` UIPROJECT_TARGET`: Specifies the target platform (web or desktop).
* ` UIPROJECT_THEME`: Defines the default theme for the UI components.

**Usage**

UiProject provides a comprehensive API for building UI components. Here's a basic example of creating a button component:
